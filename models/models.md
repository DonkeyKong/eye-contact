# What's the deal with these models?

**Q:** Where did they come from?

**A:** They come from Google's MediaPipe framework. I did not create them or convert them for TFLite. I got them from the [face-detection-tflite github repo](https://github.com/patlevin/face-detection-tflite/tree/main/fdlite/data).

**Q:** What is the license on these models?

**A:** I have no idea whatsoever. They might not be free. I am using them privately and non-commercially and have them posted to github for convenieince. I figure I found them on github and they've been up for years, so it's probably ok. If you are the owner and this is not ok, please let me know. Before using them for anything commercial, I suggest looking into this harder than I did.

**Q:** How did you learn how to make use of them in plain C++ code?

**A:** I learned how to use them from C++ in [mediapipe-face-detector-cpp on github](https://github.com/milinddeore/mediapipe-face-detector-cpp)
